    <h1>Welcome to the Major Projects Lessons Learned System</h1>

<div id="HomePageContent">
    <h2>As a Business Process Owner (BPO), this site will allow you to add lessons, search the database, update and track the lessons you are responsible for validating.</h2>
    
    <p class="indent">The tabs above will help in the validation process:</p>

    <p class="indent"><span class="fancy-text">My Lessons:</span> This tab provides you with a list of lessons your discipline is responsible for, in all stages of the validation lifecycle.</p>

    <p class="indent"><span class="fancy-text">Submit:</span> This tab allows you to submit lessons into the database to start the validation process.  Note:  Before submitting a lesson into the database, please have a conversation with the Lessons Learned Coordinator assigned to the project you are working on, to ensure they have not already captured the lesson.  It is their responsibility to collect and submit lessons for each project.</p>

    <p class="indent"><span class="fancy-text">Validate:</span> This tab allows you to review the content of each lesson you are responsible for and update it with validation information.  If you need additional information on a lesson or need to re-direct the lesson to a different BPO, you can do that here.  It is recommended to enter an “estimated completion” date and comments in the appropriate fields to help Lessons Learned Coordinators track the lessons they submit. Once the lesson has been validated and you have updated the required fields, you must close the lesson to make it available for searching.</p>

    <p class="indent"><span class="fancy-text">Search:</span> This tab provides you with a variety of fields to search on to help narrow down search results.</p>

    <p class="indent"><span class="fancy-text">Dashboard:</span> This tab allows you to visually see a breakdown of the lesson your discipline is responsible for validating.   You have the ability to click into the open lessons pie chart or key, to quickly see all lessons in that grouping. The historical view allows you to see the lessons your discipline has closed, by year.</p>

    <p class="indent"><span class="fancy-text">Help:</span> There are two icons you will see on the screen to help guide you through the site.</p>

    <p class="indent">The <span class="web-sprite sprite-help-browser" style="float:left;position:relative; left:53px;"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; icon is for tool tips and when hovered over with your mouse will provide additional information about functionality.</p>

    <p class="indent">The <span class="web-sprite sprite-cursor-help" style="float:left;position:relative; left:53px;"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; icon provides a description of the field and is visible when you hover over a field name (e.g. Project Name = The official name of the project you are generating lessons for).</p>
